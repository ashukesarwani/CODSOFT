						<span id="first-letter">S</span>rinivasa Ramanujan was an Indian mathematician born in present
						day Tamil Nadu. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made
						extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and
						continued fractions. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation;
						it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became obvious and known to
						the wider mathematical community, centered in Europe at the time, he began a famous partnership
						with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy. The Cambridge professor realized that Ramanujan had
						rediscovered previously known theorems in addition to producing new ones.
					</p>
					<p class="passage">
						Ramanujan contnuously experienced failure academically and never obtained a degree until he was
						in Cambridge. There he obtained a Bachelor's in Science (B.Sc) in 1916.
					</p>

					<p class="passage">
						Ramanujan was plagued by health problems throughout his life. His health worsened in England. He
						was diagnosed with tuberculosis and a severe vitamin deficiency, and was confined to a
						sanatorium. He returned to Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency in 1919 and died soon thereafter at the
						age of 32 in 1920. His widow, S. Janaki Ammal, moved to Bombay. She returned to Chennai
						(formerly Madras) in 1950, where she lived until her death at age 95 in 1994
